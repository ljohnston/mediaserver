== Media Server Build ==

Ansible project to configure my media server.

My media server is pretty based on these (started with the 2016 link, the
second link came along after I'd already gotten something built):

https://www.linuxserver.io/2016/02/02/the-perfect-media-server-2016/
https://www.linuxserver.io/2017/06/24/the-perfect-media-server-2017/

Much of this ansible config from this repo from the author of both of the pages
above:

My inital build was done by hand just because I was (stupidly) in a hurry (why?
I don't know...). This project is an effort to fix that.

This project include vagrant for local development.
